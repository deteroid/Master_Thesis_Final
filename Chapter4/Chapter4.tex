\section{Architecture Overview}

Integrating SAP S/4HANA with Salesforce using the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Integration Suite enables seamless DS betweenERP andCRM systems. This integration facilitates real-time data exchange, streamlines business processes, and enhances operational efficiency.

SAP S/4HANA is anERP business suite built on the SAP HANA in-memory database platform. It is an on-premise system designed to facilitate the management of diverse business processes within an organization. On the other hand, Salesforce is a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform specializing inCRM, offering tools to automate sales and marketing processes for enterprises.

The integration framework within SAP Cloud Integration for SAP S/4HANA and Salesforce enables the synchronization of master data, including product, customer, and pricing information. This integration framework supports the automation of business processes by connecting SAP S/4HANA with Salesforce through the SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI). Data is extracted from SAP S/4HANA using the OData adapter, which is then mapped and transformed into a structure compatible with Salesforce SObjects. Subsequently, the transformed data is transmitted to Salesforce via the Salesforce Adapter. In scenarios where data flows from Salesforce to SAP S/4HANA, the information is similarly transformed and mapped within SAP CPI before being sent to SAP S/4HANA using the OData adapter. This bidirectional integration ensures seamless data exchange and process automation between the two systems.

        \item Enter the \textbf{Salesforce username} and \textbf{password} associated with the account that will be used for authentication.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Deploying the Credentials:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Click on \textbf{Deploy} to securely store and activate the credentials for use within the integration process.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Procedure for Deploying Token}

To securely store and utilize authentication tokens within \textbf{SAP Cloud Platform Integration (SAP CPI)}, it is essential to deploy the token using the \textit{Secure Parameter} functionality. This ensures that sensitive credentials, such as a Salesforce token, are securely managed within the SAP CPI environment. The following steps outline the procedure to configure and deploy the secure parameter for authentication:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Access the SAP CPI Tenant}: \\
    Log in to the \textbf{SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI)} tenant and navigate to the \textit{Monitor} section to access system management tools.
    
    \item \textbf{Navigate to Security Management}: \\
    Within the \textit{Monitor} section, locate and click on \textit{Manage Security}. From the available options, select \textit{Security Material} to manage authentication credentials.
    
    \item \textbf{Add a Secure Parameter}: \\
    Click on the \textit{Add} dropdown menu and select \textit{Secure Parameter} from the list of available security material types.
    
    \item \textbf{Configure the Secure Parameter}: \\
    In the configuration screen, provide a meaningful \textit{Name} for the secure parameter. This name will be used in integration flows (iFlows) to reference the stored token. Enter the \textbf{Salesforce authentication token} in the \textit{Secure Parameter} field. This ensures that the token is securely stored and can be retrieved dynamically during API authentication.
    
    \item \textbf{Deploy the Secure Parameter}: \\
    Click on the \textit{Deploy} button to save and activate the secure parameter within the SAP CPI environment. Upon successful deployment, the secure parameter becomes available for use in \textit{integration flows (iFlows)}, enabling secure and seamless authentication when interacting with external systems, such as Salesforce.
\end{enumerate}

By following this structured approach, organizations can ensure the \textbf{secure storage and management of authentication tokens}, thereby enhancing the security and compliance of their integration processes within SAP CPI.



\subsubsection{Replicate Account from SAP S/4HANA to Salesforce}

This integration flow facilitates the replication of customer master data from SAP S/4HANA to Salesforce, where the data is mapped to the Accounts object. Whenever a customer record is created or modified in SAP S/4HANA, the changes are automatically replicated to Salesforce during the next execution of the integration flow, provided it is scheduled to run recurrently. This process ensures that Salesforce remains synchronized with the latest customer data from SAP S/4HANA. Figure 4.5 illustrates the business process implemented through this integration flow, highlighting the seamless data transfer and synchronization between the two systems.
